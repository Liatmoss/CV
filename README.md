## Summary

I have recently finished studying at Makers Academy completing their intensive developer bootcamp.

Having taught for the last six years before changing careers, I have experience writing curriculum and developing workshops and learning materials for teachers and students in STEAM subjects. I also have experience coordinating events and computing clubs to get students, especially girls, interested in these subject areas. I have experience working with micro:bits and Raspberry Pi's in schools and at various events.

## Skills

#### Communication

In my previous positions, good communication skills were vital. A large part of my job was working with children and adults to teach new concepts. I needed to make sure that the subject matter was presented clearly and that by the end of the session everything had been understood. While at Makers Academy I further developed this skill through the group projects and pair programming.

#### Teamwork

Working as part of a team I am comfortable being in a leadership position as well as taking direction. In my previous position I managed a small team of teachers ensuring that each school had a member of staff to teach the clubs that I was responsible for. In my final project at Makers I facilitated morning standups as well as evening retros daily to ensure that we were on track with our objectives to deliver the final project. In our other group projects, I followed direction given by other group members ensuring to communicate what my pair partner and I had accomplished each day.

## Experience

**Freelance Consultant** (April 2019 - September 2019)    
As a freelance education technology consultant, I worked with a variety of companies writing and facilitating coding and computing workshops and camps. This often involved ensuring teachers were familiar with the curriculum and were supported in teaching the required content.

**Jewish Interactive** (August 2015 - April 2019)    
*J-STEAM Director/Computing Lead*  
As the STEAM Director at Jewish Interactive, my role included coordinating Hakathons and STEAM activities in the UK and United States. I also ran and coordinated computing clubs and holiday camps for primary school students focusing on coding with Scratch, micro:bit and Raspberry Pi. For these activities I wrote and designed customised curriculum solutions for each club and camp which varied depending on the available resources and the level and experience of the attending students.

**Menorah Primary School** (January 2014 - March 2015)   
*Computing Coordinator/Computing Teacher*  
While working at Menorah Primary School, I was the Computing Coordinator as well as the Computing Teacher. I managed the computing lessons for years 3 - 6 in the afternoons while still teaching my regular year 1 class in the morning. My responsibilities in this role included writing the Computing Curriculum for the school as well as training staff on new elements of the curriculum including new technologies which needed to be incorporated into the classroom.

## Interests

* Hardware - I enjoy tinkering and building with hardware such as the Raspberry Pi, Micro:Bit and Adafruit's Gemma board. I create and design wearables based on these devices with LED's and sensors
* Travel - I try to experiencing as many new cultures, cities and countries as possible
* Cooking and Baking - In my spare time I like to try new recipes
