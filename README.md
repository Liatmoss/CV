## Summary

I have recently finished studying at Makers Academy completing their intensive developer bootcamp.

Having taught for the last six years before changing careers, I have experience writing curriculum and developing workshops and learning materials for teachers and students in STEAM subjects. I also have experience coordinating events and computing clubs to get students, especially girls, interested in these subject areas. I have experience working with micro:bits and Raspberry Pi's in schools and at various events.

## Experience

**Jewish Interactive** (August 2015 - April 2019)    
*J-STEAM Director/Computing Lead*  
As the STEAM Director at Jewish Interactive, my role included coordinating Hakathons and STEAM activities in the UK and United States. I also ran and coordinated computing clubs and holiday camps for primary school students focusing on coding with Scratch, micro:bit and Raspberry Pi. For these activities I wrote and designed customised curriculum solutions for each club and camp which varied depending on the available resources and the level and experience of the attending students.

**Menorah Primary School** (January 2014 - March 2015)   
*Computing Coordinator/Computing Teacher*  
While working at Menorah Primary School, I was the Computing Coordinator as well as the Computing Teacher. I managed the computing lessons for years 3 - 6 in the afternoons while still teaching my regular year 1 class in the morning. My responsibilities in this role included writing the Computing Curriculum for the school as well as training staff on new elements of the curriculum including new technologies which needed to be incorporated into the classroom.
