## Liat Moss

Having taught primary school coding and robotics for six years, I decided that I wanted a new challenge. As a self-taught coder, I enjoyed finding creative solutions to problems and seeing my programs come to life.

I am currently studying at Makers Academy completing their twelve week intensive developer bootcamp.
